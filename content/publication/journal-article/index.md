abstract: Exposure to ambient particulate matters (PMs) has been associated with a variety of lung diseases, and high-fat diet (HFD) was reported to exacerbate PM-induced lung dysfunction. However, the underlying mechanisms for the combined effects of HFD and PM on lung functions remain poorly unraveled. By performing a comparative proteomic analysis, the current study investigated the global changes of histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) in rat lung exposed to long-term, real-world PMs. In result, after PM exposure the abundance of four individual histone PTMs (1 down-regulated and 3 up-regulated) and six combinatorial PTMs (1 down-regulated and 5 up-regulated) were significantly altered in HFD-fed rats while only one individual PTM was changed in rats with normal diet (ND) feeding. Histones H3K18ac, H4K8ac and H4K12ac were reported to be associated with DNA damage response, and we found that these PTMs were enhanced by PM in HFD-fed rats. Together with the elevated DNA damage levels in rat lungs following PM and HFD co-exposure, we demonstrate that PM exposure combined with HFD could induce lung injury through altering more histone modifications accompanied by DNA damage. Overall, these Ô¨Åndings will augment our knowledge of the epigenetic mechanisms for pulmonary toxicity caused by ambient PM and HFD exposure.
